This repository contains my implementations for lab 1 of the SC2005 (Operating Systems) module under NTU. It includes some demonstrations of (1) how to imeplement custom system calls in xv6, and (2) how to utilize pipes for communication between forked processes.

# About xv6
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

This version is a fork of MIT's xv6 available at https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv. We are grateful for MIT for rendering its teaching operating system widely available. 

Further information about xv6 can found in its online book at https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2025/xv6/book-riscv-rev5.pdf.

# Installation 
This version was tested on Ubuntu 24.04. The following tools are required: QEMU 7.2+, GDB 8.3+, GCC, and Binutils. Install with: 
```sh
sudo apt-get install git build-essential gdb-multiarch qemu-system-misc gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu 
```

To build and run xv6, use `make qemu`. 
To quit qemu type: `Ctrl-a x` (press Ctrl and a at the same time, followed by x).
